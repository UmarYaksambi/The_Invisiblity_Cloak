# Invisibility Cloak README

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Invisibility Cloak** project‚Äîdesigned to bring a magical experience straight out of the wizarding world to the realm of Muggles using computer vision and OpenCV! This project allows you to disappear with the help of a cloak, much like the legendary invisibility cloak Harry Potter himself used. With a few spells (or lines of Python), you can watch yourself vanish before your very eyes.

The cloak should ideally be a **single color** to ensure the magic works effectively and seamlessly conceals you.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- Required Magical Libraries (Python Libraries):
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
  - Numpy

Install these dependencies with the following incantation:

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/UmarYaksambi/The_Invisiblity_Cloak.git
   cd The_Invisiblity_Cloak
   ```

2. **Run the Spell (Code):**
   Execute the following incantation in your terminal:
   ```sh
   python Cloak.py
   ```

3. **Magic Unfolds:**
   The spell comprises three magical steps:
   - **Step 1:** Capturing the Background (like casting a charm to freeze the scenery)
   - **Step 2:** Cloak Authentication (ensuring the cloak is truly magical)
   - **Step 3:** Cloak Disappearance Effect (witness the magic as you vanish)

## Application Workflow

### Step 1: Capture the Background
- Begin by **stepping out of the frame** completely, much like leaving the room for Dobby to work his elf-magic!
- A **loading indicator** will appear on-screen as the background is being captured.
- If a **human presence** is detected, the application will raise an `"Intruder Alert: Step Away for Cloak Activation"` warning (because only wizards know how to perform magic).
- Once the coast is clear, the background is captured and saved‚Äîready to assist in your grand vanishing act.

### Step 2: Authenticate the Cloak
- The next step is to **display the cloak** (a solid-colored fabric) so that the application can determine if it‚Äôs enchanted.
- A **loading indicator** appears once more.
- The cloak‚Äôs color is analyzed and authenticated by capturing the **average HSV value** from the central region of the frame. 
- If authenticated, a success message will be displayed‚Äîcongratulations, you now hold a real invisibility cloak!

### Step 3: Disappear (It‚Äôs Magic Time!)
- With the background captured and the cloak verified, it‚Äôs time to witness magic.
- Simply **wear the cloak**, and watch in awe as it is recognized and replaced by the captured background.
- The rest of the frame remains unaffected, creating the mystical illusion that the wearer has truly disappeared.

## Key Magical Features
- **Human Detection:** Like the **Marauder's Map**, the application uses a detection mechanism (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) to ensure no prying eyes are around during background capture.
- **Background Capture:** Enchants the scenery so it can later be summoned to replace the cloak.
- **Cloak Authentication:** Ensures only a true invisibility cloak works‚Äîany ordinary blanket just won‚Äôt do!
- **Invisibility Effect:** The cloak is magically replaced with the background, making the wearer vanish.

## Running the Spell Step-by-Step

1. **Start the Magic:**
   - After chanting (running the script), a window named **"Invisibility Cloak - Get ready to disappear!"** will appear.
   - A prompt saying `"Press Esc to exit"` is displayed in case you need to reverse the magic.

2. **Capture the Background:**
   - The application checks for any Muggles or creatures in the frame.
   - If a human presence is detected, `"Intruder Alert: Step Away for Cloak Activation"` will appear until the frame is empty.
   - Once the frame is clear, the background is captured, and the scenery is frozen.

3. **Authenticate Your Cloak:**
   - After background capture, you‚Äôll be prompted to present your cloak.
   - The spell `"Is your cloak truly enchanted?"` will be displayed, indicating it's time to **hold the cloak** in front of the camera.
   - Once successfully authenticated, the cloak‚Äôs enchantment is captured and prepared for the final magic.

4. **Disappear with the Cloak:**
   - With the background and cloak prepared, **don the cloak** and watch the magic happen.
   - The cloak region is replaced with the captured background, and behold‚Äîyou‚Äôre invisible!
   - To undo the magic and exit, press the **Esc** key.

## Notes for Aspiring Wizards
- The cloak must be **single-colored**‚Äîthis is key to make the magic work properly.
- It‚Äôs best to perform this magic in a **well-lit area**, as darkness will weaken the effect.
- Ensure the cloak **covers enough of yourself** to make the disappearance impressive.
- During background capture and cloak authentication, **stay still**‚Äîeven the best wizards need focus.

## Troubleshooting your Magic
- **Intruder Alert Won't Disappear:** Make sure all Muggles and magical creatures step out of the frame.
- **Cloak Not Detected Properly:** Try using a bright, unique color‚Äîavoid colors that blend with your background or surroundings.
- **No Effect When Wearing Cloak:** Hold the cloak in the center for authentication and ensure it‚Äôs a mono-color fabric.
